# PolyMGen
PolyMGen is a library for parallel quality mesh generation of many polytopes, such as polygons and polyhedrons.  
It is created with the purpose of use in solving boundary-value problems for polycrystal by the finite element method.

## Example:
```c++
// Number of cubes along the corresponding axis.
std::size_t nX = 2, nY = 4, nZ = 8;
psg::PolyShell shell = psg::generateCuboids(nX, nY, nZ);
pmg::PolyhedralSet polyhset(shell);

// Preferred tetrahedron edge length.
double preferredLength = 0.45;
polyhset.tetrahedralize(preferredLength);
polyhset.output(pmg::FileType::WavefrontObj); // Or pmg::FileType::LsDynaKeyword
```
