# Polymgen
Polymgen is a library for generating tetrahedral mesh of many polyhedrons. 
It is created with the purpose of use in solving boundary-value problems for polycrystal by the finite element method.
# Example:
```c++
// Number of cubes along the corresponding axis.
size_t nX = 3, nY = 3, nZ = 3;
polygen::PolyStruct polyStruct = generateCuboidsPolycrystal(nX, nY, nZ);
pmg::PolyhedralSet polyhedr(polyStruct);

double preferredTetrahedronEdgeLength = 0.45;
polyhedr.generateMesh(preferredTetrahedronEdgeLength);
pmg::PolyMesh* mesh = polyhedr.structurizeMesh();
...
delete mesh;
```
